# Guide for CoCart JWT Authentication

## How It Works

Hereâ€™s how the authentication process works in your WordPress application:

1. Authentication Request

Client authenticates the login endpoint via Authorization header using the basic method to obtain JWT tokens.

1. Token Usage

Use the JWT token to authenticate any REST API requests via Authorization header using bearer method.

3. Token Refresh

Use refresh token to obtain new access tokens without re-authentication via the refresh-token endpoint.
