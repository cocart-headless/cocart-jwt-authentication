# Creating Branches

Branch names should go by the following structure (anything in "{}" brackets is a placeholder). "{short-slug}" should be replaced with a short name that best describes the changes - do ask for confirmation if needed.
- `release/{version}` for release branches.
- `refactor/{short-slug}` for refactors.
- `test/{short-slug}` for changes that are only test updates or additions.
- `fix/{short-slug}` for changes that fix a bug. Prompt the user for the issue number the fix is for and include that in the branch name.
- `add/{short-slug}` for changes that are adding a new feature.

# Commits

Make sure each commit addresses an atomic unit of work that independently works.

Make sure the commit message has a subject line which includes a brief description of the change and (if needed), why it was necessary. Write the subject in the imperative, start with a verb, and do not end with a period. The subject line should be no longer than 50 characters.

There must be an empty line between the subject line and the rest of the commit message (if any). The commit body should be no longer than 72 characters.

The commit message should explain what caused the problem and what its consequences are (if helpful for understanding the changes).

The commit message should explain how the changes achieve the goal, but only if it isn't obvious.
