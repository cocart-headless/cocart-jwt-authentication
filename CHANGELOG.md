# Changelog for CoCart JWT Authentication

## v2.0.0 - ?? February, 2025

ðŸ“¢ This update will invalidate previous tokens as they will no longer be valid.

### What's New?

* Bind tokens to specific IP addresses or devices to mitigate token misuse.
* Algorithm can be changed to any other supported. See: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7518#section-3
* Refresh token with new REST API endpoint `cocart/jwt/refresh-token`.

### Changes

* Token expires after 10 days by default not 2 hours.
* Filter `cocart_jwt_auth_expire` added token issuance timestamp as parameter.

### Improvements

* Authentication errors have been simplified so they are harder to identify.

### For Developers

[See documentation](docs/filters.md) for examples on how to use these filters.

* Introduced new filter `cocart_jwt_auth_issuer` to change the token issuer (iss claim) for multi-site setups or custom API endpoints.
* Introduced new filter `cocart_jwt_auth_issued_at` to change the token issuance timestamp (iat claim) for token timing synchronization.
* Introduced new filter `cocart_jwt_auth_not_before` to change the timestamp.
* Introduced new filter `cocart_jwt_auth_algorithm` to change to any other supported algorithms.
* Introduced new filter `cocart_jwt_auth_refresh_token_generation` to change how refresh tokens are generated.
