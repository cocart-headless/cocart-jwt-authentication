JWT Authentication for CoCart API.

== Description ==

This free add-on for [CoCart](https://cocartapi.com/?utm_medium=wp.org&utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=cocart) allows you to authenticate the Cart API via JSON Web Tokens as an authentication method.

JSON Web Tokens are an open standard [RFC 7519](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519) for securely transmitting information between parties.

[Read the core concept for more information](https://github.com/cocart-headless/cocart-jwt-authentication/blob/master/docs/concepts.md) on what this plugin does and can do.

### Key Features

* **Standard JWT Authentication**: Implements the industry-standard RFC 7519 for secure claims representation.
* **Simple Endpoints**: Offers clear endpoints for generating and validating tokens.
* **Configurable Secret Key**: Define your unique secret key via `wp-config.php` for secure token signing.
* **Multiple signing algorithms**: `HS256`, `HS384`, `HS512`, `RS256`, `RS384`, `RS512`, `ES256`, `ES384`, `ES512`, `PS256`, `PS384`, `PS512`
* **Rate Limiting**: Controlled specifically for refreshing and validating tokens. Requires [CoCart Plus](https://cocartapi.com/?utm_medium=website&utm_source=wpplugindirectory&utm_campaign=readme&utm_content=readmelink)
* **Helpful Debugging**: Detailed logs of authentication issues to help figure out exactly what happened and fix it faster.
* **WP-CLI Commands**: Useful [commands to handle tokens](/docs/wp-cli.md) - whether you need to check them, create new ones, or clean up old ones.
