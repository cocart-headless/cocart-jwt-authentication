> An excellent plugin, which makes building a headless WooCommerce experience a breeze. Easy to use, nearly zero setup time. [Harald Schneider](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/excellent-plugin-8062/)

## Enable PHP HTTP Authorization Header

### üñ•Ô∏è Shared Hosts

Most shared hosts have disabled the **HTTP Authorization Header** by default.

To enable this option you'll need to edit your **.htaccess** file by adding the following:

`
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization} ^(.*)
RewriteRule ^(.*) - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%1]
`

or

`
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]
`

### WPEngine

To enable this option you'll need to edit your **.htaccess** file by adding the following (see [this issue](https://github.com/Tmeister/wp-api-jwt-auth/issues/1)):

`
SetEnvIf Authorization "(.*)" HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=$1
`

## üß∞ Configuration

1. Set a unique secret key in your `wp-config.php` file defined to `COCART_JWT_AUTH_SECRET_KEY`.
2. Install and activate plugin.

### Token Expiration

By default, the token expires after two full days but can be filtered to change to your preference using this hook `cocart_jwt_auth_expire`.

Here is an example changing it to expire after just 2 hours.

`
add_filter( 'cocart_jwt_auth_expire', function() {
  return MINUTE_IN_SECONDS * 120
});
`

## üìÑ Usage

1. Authenticate via basic method with the login endpoint to get your token.
2. Store the given token under `jwt_token` in your application.
3. Now authenticate any cart route with `Bearer` authentication with the token given.
