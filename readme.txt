## Enable PHP HTTP Authorization Header

### üñ•Ô∏è Shared Hosts

Most shared hosts have disabled the **HTTP Authorization Header** by default.

To enable this option you'll need to edit your **.htaccess** file by adding the following:

`
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization} ^(.*)
RewriteRule ^(.*) - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%1]
`

or

`
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]
`

### WPEngine

To enable this option you'll need to edit your **.htaccess** file by adding the following outside of IfModule:

`
SetEnvIf Authorization "(.*)" HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=$1
`

Example of what that looks like.

`
# BEGIN WordPress
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization} ^(.*)
RewriteRule ^(.*) - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%1]
</IfModule>

SetEnvIf Authorization "(.*)" HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=$1
# END WordPress
`

## üß∞ Configuration

1. Set a unique secret key in your `wp-config.php` file defined to `COCART_JWT_AUTH_SECRET_KEY`.
2. Install and activate plugin.

### Token Expiration

By default, the token expires after 10 full days but can be filtered to change to your preference using this hook `cocart_jwt_auth_expire`.

Here is an example changing it to expire after just 2 days.

`
add_filter( 'cocart_jwt_auth_expire', function() {
  return DAYS_IN_SECONDS * 2
});
`

## üìÑ Usage

1. Authenticate via basic method with the CoCart login endpoint `cocart/v2/login` to get your token.
2. Store the given token under `jwt_token` in your application.
3. Now authenticate any cart route with `Bearer` authentication with the token given.
